It’s a top-down shooter in which you play as a wizard trying to rid a dungeon of evil demons. On your way down you encounter more and more enemies each time, so many that it seems like there is to be no end in sight soon, or ever....

You can shoot projectiles of pure magic towards the demons, and because of the demonic magic in the walls, your bullets will bounce all around.

The demons will wander aimlessly until you get too close.
But watch out, the demons will sometimes be strong enough to fire their own magic towards you.
There is also a rarer green demon appearing in the dungeon, watch out for this one because it tends to charge at you at full speed when it’s aggravated.

Try to get as deep into the dungeon as you can, slaying all demons you encounter.
